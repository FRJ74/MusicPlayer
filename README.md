# MusicPlayer

Now I will learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(), wich are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

In this project, I'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. Additionally, I'll learn how to dynamically update the user interface based on the current song.
